          <h2 class="title">DENSITY BY COUNTRY</h2>
	  <p>Here, I'm creating Choropleth world maps to look at restaurant density by country.</p>
	  <h3 class="subtitle">DENSITY OF RESTAURANTS BY COUNTRY</h3>
	  <p>The plot below shows the country locations and the number of restaurants for each. It 
			becomes clear right away that India has a disproportionally large number of restaurants 
			compared to the others. <br> <img src="images/country_num.png" alt="alt text"></p>
	  <h3 class="subtitle">TOP 3 CUISINE (DENSITY OF RESTAURANT BY COUNTRY)</h3>
	  <p>There are some quick conclusions to be made. It was made clear before that India has the highest 
		  overall density, but now we can see that it has the highest density of restaurants for all 
		  3 of the most prevalent cuisines. In the case of the Mughlai cuisine, India is one of only 
		  two countries that serves it. There is a large disparity shown here between India and 
		  the other countries. But since we are only looking at 15 countries and the data doesn't 
		  account for all restaurants, it's still too early to make definitive conclusions.</p>
	  <h2 class="title">BEST RATED</h2>
	  <p>Here, I'm creating bar charts to visualize the best rated restaurants and cuisines for each country.</p>
	  <h3 class="subtitle">BEST RATED RESTAURANTS</h3>
	  <p>Since there are 15 countries to look through, I instead just took the two countries 
			with the greatest number of restaurants (India and United States). We can see some 
			interesting patterns occuring. For India, there's a clear upward trend. We expect there 
			to be less highly rated restaurants, which is about expected. But for the US, we can 
			see that the greatest number of restaurants are around the "Good" range (3.6-4.3). Of course, 
			again we cannot reach any strong conclusions just based off of this, since India has 
			thousands of more sample points than the US.<strong> Click the images below for a closer

          <h2 class="title">PRICE/RATING</h2>
	  <p>Here, I'm creating bar charts to look at average price and rating for each country.</p>
	  <h3 class="subtitle">AVERAGE PRICE AND RATING BY COUNTRY</h3>
	  <p>Here, I'm interested in seeing if there is any correlation to be found between price and 
		  rating. Also, there may be an effect on these two features depending on the country, so 
		  it is important to make judgements based on previous information on restaurant density 
		  for each country.</p>
