	  <p>Here, I report on the overall project. Like a typical report, I describe my processs 
		  of thought and the conclusions reached.</p>
	  <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
          <p>The restaurant industry is one of enormous competition. A combination of a large 
			  number of restaurants placed in close proximity to each other, and the variety in 
			  cuisine options creates a difficulty in entering and succeeding in this industry. For 
			  restaurant owners, it is important to determine which restaurants are more likely to 
			  succeed in their country or city. This project utilizes visualizations to display the 
			  geographical distribution of cuisine types and describe the differences in ratings for 
			  the best restaurants in the world. The aspects of this analysis that best determines 
			  where restaurants are most likely to succeed are heavily focused on restaurant 
			  distribution and cuisine type. This correlation is fairly obvious when looking at the 
			  percentages of restaurants in each country and the percentages of cuisine types from 
			  top-rated restaurants. This report will discuss the various objectives, requirements, 
			  and conclusions explored in this project.</p>
